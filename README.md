Factorial Calculation in Python

This repository contains a Python script to calculate the factorial of a given number.

About Factorial

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. For example, `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`.

Implementation

The factorial calculation is implemented in Python using an iterative approach. The script `factorial.py` defines a function `factorial(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the factorial of `n`.

Usage

To use the factorial calculation script, follow these steps:

   Clone this repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/factorial-calculation.git
   
   Navigate to the repository directory:
   bash
   cd factorial-calculation
   
   Run the script with Python:
   bash
   python factorial.py
   
   Enter a non-negative integer when prompted to calculate its factorial.

Example

Here's an example of calculating the factorial of 5 using the script:
bash
Enter a number to calculate its factorial: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120
